# Lead Producer - Full-Stack AI Product Team

**AI agent work is probabilistic.** Better guardrails, sharper routing, stronger architecture, and
more diverse perspectives on the same problem all increase the odds of a good outcome. Lead
Producer is built to make that reliability practical: one entry point, the right specialists,
explicit stress-testing, and clear recommendations instead of scattered guesses.

This pack models agent work after real software professions because those structures improve
decision quality. Roles, teams, and workflows give agents boundaries, accountability, and multiple
angles on design, frontend, backend, product, QA, smart contracts, deployment, live ops,
iteration, and cleanup.

Complex games that run from conception to live service are one of the hardest environments in
software development. MMO-scale work punishes weak context and bad coordination, whether the team
is human or agentic. That is why this library is tuned to stay lean on context and efficient on
routing so agents can spend more attention on the development itself: economies, progression,
exploits, incidents, rollout risk, and tightly coupled systems. If it can handle that, it becomes
broadly useful across other software work too.

57 total skills: 1 coordinator + 56 specialist skills (34 roles, 12 teams, 10 workflows). Use it
across the full product lifecycle: prototype, design, implementation, testing, deployment, live
ops, iteration, and code cleanup. It includes host guides for **Claude Code** and **OpenAI Codex**
on macOS, Linux, and Windows. Windows is in good shape. macOS and Linux still need a quick real
world check.

## Who It's For

- Teams using Claude Code or Codex that want one LP-first entrypoint instead of ad hoc specialist prompting.
- Best fit: complex software products with tightly coupled systems, especially games, marketplaces, economies, live-service, and launch-critical operations.
- Not a product-context pack. It ships generic specialist skills and expects project-specific overlays separately.

## What It Looks Like

**Claude Code request**

```text
/lead-producer Review my crafting economy for exploits. Players craft items
from gathered resources and sell on the marketplace.
```

**Codex request**

```text
Use $lead-producer to review my crafting economy for exploits. Players craft
items from gathered resources and sell on the marketplace.
```

**Lead Producer routes to:** Red Team (adversarial) + Economy Team (structural)

**Output**

```text
LEAD PRODUCER REPORT
====================
Route Now: team-red-team, team-economy-team
Suggested Play: none
Route Rationale: Red Team (exploit surface) + Economy Team (faucet/sink balance); no product-specific context loaded

FINDINGS (synthesized):

1. CRITICAL - Infinite craft loop: If crafting output is tradeable AND
   disassembly returns inputs, players can cycle items through alts to
   generate net-positive materials. Exploit requires only 2 accounts.
   Fix: disassembly returns 60-80% of inputs (configurable sink).

2. HIGH - Marketplace price floor bypass: Rare materials have no minimum
   listing price. Attackers can list at 1 currency to manipulate price
   oracles downstream. Fix: enforce floor at crafting-cost basis.

3. MEDIUM - Gathering bot profitability: Resource nodes respawn on fixed
   timers. Bot ROI is positive above 3 nodes/minute. Fix: randomize
   respawn windows +/-30% and add diminishing returns per-account.
```

This is what a coordinated AI skill pack looks like: one prompt, structured analysis, and a
prioritized action plan.

---

## Why This Exists

AI coding assistants are generalists. They will often give you surface-level feedback on economy
design, miss non-obvious exploit chains, and skip the step where their own recommendations get
stress-tested.

This pack replaces "ask an assistant and hope" with a structured review process: domain specialists
analyze the problem, a Devil's Advocate challenges their assumptions, and the Lead Producer
synthesizes everything into an actionable result with evidence standards and severity rankings.
The point is not bigger prompts. It is to make agents behave more like decision systems: surface
evidence, compare trade-offs, state confidence, and make the next step obvious.

It also comes from synthesis, not reinvention. This pack draws inspiration from `superpowers`,
`compilation7`, `gstack`, and Claude Code Game Studios, then adapts those ideas into a coordinated
system for end-to-end MMO and live-service development. It is not a direct fork or bundled
dependency on any of them.

AI-era testing guidance (TDD hazards, AI-generated test quality, evaluator independence) draws from
Anthropic's [Harness Design for Long-Running Application Development](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/harness-design-long-running-apps)
and Halldór Fannar's [Your Tests Are Still the Real Assets](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/your-tests-still-real-assets-halldor-fannar/) (Augmented newsletter, March 2026).
Language-specific review expertise (C++, Go, Rust, Python, Kotlin, Java) adapted from
Affaan's [everything-claude-code](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code).

You do not need to know the internal routing. Describe the problem. The Lead Producer figures out
who to call, or whether to suggest a deeper play before routing.

That only works if the pack stays lean. It loads only the roles, teams, and workflows a task
actually needs so the model keeps its context window for the work itself instead of burning it on
unused guidance. Less prompt bloat means better focus and fewer hallucinations from irrelevant
instructions.

## Quick Start

### Host Chooser

| Host | Install Step | First Prompt | Manual Success Signal | Next Doc |
|------|--------------|--------------|----------------|----------|
| Claude Code | Link this repo's `.claude` into your project | `/lead-producer Review this onboarding guide for clarity and accuracy.` | First lines include `Route Now: team-documentation` and `Suggested Play: none` | [`.claude/CLAUDE.md`](.claude/CLAUDE.md) |
| OpenAI Codex | Run the installer for your host OS | `Use $lead-producer to investigate why reward claims intermittently fail after reconnect. Find the root cause before fixing.` | First lines include `Route Now: workflow-systematic-debugging` and `Suggested Play: none` | [`.codex/INSTALL.md`](.codex/INSTALL.md) |

### Claude Code

Clone the pack once, then link its `.claude` directory into the project where you want to use
`/lead-producer`.

**macOS / Linux**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saemihemma/lead-producer.git
cd lead-producer
ln -s "$(pwd)/.claude" /path/to/your/project/.claude
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/saemihemma/lead-producer.git
Set-Location lead-producer
New-Item -ItemType Junction -Path 'C:\path\to\your\project\.claude' -Target "$PWD\.claude"
```

If your project already has a `.claude` directory, merge the needed files instead of replacing the
whole folder.

Safe merge recipe for existing `.claude` projects:

- Required: merge this repo's `.claude/skills/` into your project's `.claude/skills/` so `lead-producer` and the shipped specialist skills stay available at their canonical ids.
- Required: keep one project `CLAUDE.md`. Preserve your project-specific rules, then add the Lead Producer host rules and point runtime routing canon at `.claude/skills/lead-producer/SKILL.md`.
- Optional: merge `.claude/settings.json` only if you want this pack's bundled Claude permission defaults. If settings conflict, keep the stricter project value.
- Conflict policy: do not keep two competing route tables or rename the shipped skill folders. Merge host guidance, but let the canonical skills stay canonical.

See [`.claude/CLAUDE.md`](.claude/CLAUDE.md) for Claude host instructions and manual smoke
prompts. Runtime routing canon lives in
[`.claude/skills/lead-producer/SKILL.md`](.claude/skills/lead-producer/SKILL.md).

Start a Claude Code session in your project directory, then use `/lead-producer`.

Manual Claude success signal: first lines include `Route Now: team-documentation` and
`Suggested Play: none` for the host-chooser prompt above.

### OpenAI Codex

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saemihemma/lead-producer.git && cd lead-producer
bash ./scripts/install-codex.sh
```

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/saemihemma/lead-producer.git
Set-Location lead-producer
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\install-codex.ps1
```

The PowerShell command uses a process-scoped execution policy bypass. It does not change your
machine-wide PowerShell policy.

Restart Codex, then use `$lead-producer`. Example:

```text
Use $lead-producer to investigate why reward claims intermittently fail after reconnect. Find the root cause before fixing.
```

Manual smoke expectation: first lines include `Route Now: workflow-systematic-debugging` and
`Suggested Play: none`

See [`.codex/INSTALL.md`](.codex/INSTALL.md) for the Codex install details. Codex keeps live links
back to this clone, so keep the repo where you installed it.

---

## Platform Note

- Windows should be ready to use for Claude Code and Codex.
- If you are on macOS or Linux, do one quick sanity pass the first time you install it and flag anything odd.

## How It Works

```mermaid
graph TD
    U["You"] -->|describe task| C["Claude / Codex"]
    C -->|invoke| LP["Lead Producer"]
    LP -->|suggest play| SP["Suggested Play"]
    SP -->|user opts in| LP
    LP -->|route now| R["Role / Team / Workflow"]
    R -->|findings| LP
    LP -->|lightweight pass-through| OUT["Deliver Result"]
    LP -->|substantive recommendation| DA["Devil's Advocate"]
    DA -->|pass| ACC["LP Accepts"]
    DA -->|challenge| LP
    ACC --> OUT
    LP -->|escalate| U
```

The flow is simple: you describe a task, Lead Producer either routes immediately or recommends a
suggested play first. If LP routes now, the selected specialists send findings back to LP for
synthesis. LP can deliver lightweight pass-through results directly, but substantive
recommendations go through Devil's Advocate before acceptance. If LP suggests a play, you opt in
and LP then routes there. If the team cannot resolve a disagreement, Lead Producer escalates with
both positions documented.

## LP-First Suggested Plays

Lead Producer is still the only documented entrypoint. When a task needs understanding before
judgment, LP can recommend a deeper workflow without auto-running it:

- `Suggested Play: workflow-project-discovery` for inherited repos, broad unknowns, or discovery-first work
- `Suggested Play: workflow-current-state-capture` for bounded "what exists now" understanding before you change something

A suggested play is a recommendation, not an automatic route. If you want it, reply to LP with
"use the project discovery play" or "help me understand the current state of this system," and LP
will route there immediately.

Legacy note: older "reverse documentation" phrasing still routes through LP to current-state
capture for compatibility.

Project discovery is repo-wide. Current-state capture is bounded to one system, flow, or artifact
cluster.

## Specialist Hardening

When the stakes are high or you explicitly want deeper pressure, LP can route directly to
`workflow-specialist-hardening`. That workflow runs 3 contextualized reviewer slots per round and
keeps going until the work clears the quality bar, needs a real user decision, or stops improving.
Use it after discovery or current-state capture when understanding exists and the remaining problem
is quality.

## Frontend Companion Tooling

For frontend-heavy work, strongly prefer Playwright or an equivalent real-browser loop when the
question depends on interaction bugs, responsive behavior, accessibility, browser state, or
network and error handling. This repo does not bundle Playwright; treat it as a companion tool
that makes frontend review and debugging more trustworthy.

## Context Overlays

This is a generic specialist pack with zero product-specific knowledge. It is tuned on game and
live-service failure modes, but the routing model is useful across broader software work too.

If your game needs project-specific context, create a separate context module pack and map it to
the generic roles through a coordinator. The Lead Producer can then load those modules only when
they are explicitly named or routed in.

`.claude/skills/` is the canonical skill content. Claude Code reads it through the linked
`.claude` directory. Codex links the skill folders into `$CODEX_HOME/skills`.

`.claude/skills/lead-producer/SKILL.md` is the routing canon. Public docs and host guides should
describe it faithfully, but runtime routing semantics live there first.

`CLAUDE.md` is Claude Code host guidance. Runtime-critical routing and evidence rules belong in
skill files so Claude Code and Codex consume the same skill contract.

---

## Customization

**Add a role:** Create `.claude/skills/role-your-role/SKILL.md` with:

```yaml
---
name: role-your-role
description: "What this role does in one line"
---
```

Then update `.claude/skills/lead-producer/SKILL.md` with any runtime-facing routing change.
Mirror that change in `.claude/CLAUDE.md` only when the Claude host guidance also needs it.

**Add a team:** Same structure, plus `context: fork` in frontmatter. Add `effort: high` if the
team has 5+ members or handles a high-risk domain.

**Create a context overlay:** Create a separate pack with its own coordinator that maps the overlay
modules to the generic roles in this pack.

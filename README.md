# Lead Producer - Full-Stack AI Product Team

**A full-stack AI product team for building, reviewing, and hardening complex software.** Start
with one entry point: the Lead Producer assembles the right specialists, stress-tests the result,
and gives you a clear action plan instead of scattered opinions.

Built for MMO and live-service complexity, this pack shines on the hard stuff: economies,
progression, balance, exploits, smart contracts, live incidents, deployment risk, and systems that
interact in messy ways. That same depth makes it broadly useful outside games too: frontend design
and engineering, backend architecture, product strategy, QA, documentation, cleanup, refactors,
launch readiness, and post-launch operations.

47 AI skills: 28 specialist roles, 12 review teams, 6 structured workflows. Use it across the
full product lifecycle: prototype, design, implementation, testing, deployment, live ops,
iteration, and code cleanup. Works with **Claude Code** and **OpenAI Codex** on Mac and Windows.

## What It Looks Like

**Claude Code request**

```text
/lead-producer Review my crafting economy for exploits. Players craft items
from gathered resources and sell on the marketplace.
```

**Codex request**

```text
Use $lead-producer to review my crafting economy for exploits. Players craft
items from gathered resources and sell on the marketplace.
```

**Lead Producer routes to:** Red Team (adversarial) + Economy Team (structural)

**Output**

```text
LEAD PRODUCER REPORT
====================
Routing: Red Team (exploit surface) + Economy Team (faucet/sink balance)
Overlays: None required - no product-specific context loaded

FINDINGS (synthesized):

1. CRITICAL - Infinite craft loop: If crafting output is tradeable AND
   disassembly returns inputs, players can cycle items through alts to
   generate net-positive materials. Exploit requires only 2 accounts.
   Fix: disassembly returns 60-80% of inputs (configurable sink).

2. HIGH - Marketplace price floor bypass: Rare materials have no minimum
   listing price. Attackers can list at 1 currency to manipulate price
   oracles downstream. Fix: enforce floor at crafting-cost basis.

3. MEDIUM - Gathering bot profitability: Resource nodes respawn on fixed
   timers. Bot ROI is positive above 3 nodes/minute. Fix: randomize
   respawn windows +/-30% and add diminishing returns per-account.
```

This is what a coordinated AI skill pack looks like: one prompt, structured analysis, and a
prioritized action plan.

## Why This Exists

AI coding assistants are generalists. They will often give you surface-level feedback on economy
design, miss non-obvious exploit chains, and skip the step where their own recommendations get
stress-tested.

This pack replaces "ask an assistant and hope" with a structured review process: domain specialists
analyze the problem, a Devil's Advocate challenges their assumptions, and the Lead Producer
synthesizes everything into an actionable result with evidence standards and severity rankings.

It also comes from synthesis, not reinvention. This pack takes inspiration from strong ideas in
`superpowers`, `compilation7`, and `gstack`, then adapts them for the realities of end-to-end MMO
and live-service product development. From `gstack` we kept the parts worth their token cost:
search before building, explicit current-state and boundary framing, systematic root-cause
debugging discipline, status-quo and narrowest-wedge checks in product review, what-already-exists
and not-in-scope framing in technical review, and existing-design-leverage plus AI slop checks in
frontend review. We deliberately do not import giant preambles, telemetry, self-upgrade flows, or
slash-command sprawl. The result is not a loose pile of specialist prompts or a direct fork of
another pack, but a coordinated team for design, frontend, backend, product, QA, smart contracts,
deployment, live ops, iteration, and cleanup.

You do not need to know the internal routing. Describe the problem. The Lead Producer figures out
who to call.

## Quick Start

### Claude Code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saemihemma/lead-producer.git
cd lead-producer
ln -s "$(pwd)/.claude" /path/to/your/project/.claude
```

Start a session in your project directory, then use `/lead-producer`.

### OpenAI Codex

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saemihemma/lead-producer.git && cd lead-producer
./scripts/install-codex.sh
```

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/saemihemma/lead-producer.git
Set-Location lead-producer
.\scripts\install-codex.ps1
```

Restart Codex, then use `$lead-producer`. Example:

```text
Use $lead-producer to investigate why reward claims intermittently fail after reconnect. Find the root cause before fixing.
```

See [`.codex/INSTALL.md`](.codex/INSTALL.md) for the Codex install details.

## How It Works

```mermaid
graph TD
    U["You"] -->|describe task| C["Claude / Codex"]
    C -->|invoke| LP["Lead Producer"]
    LP -->|classify & route| S{"Select Specialists"}
    S -->|single domain| R["Role"]
    S -->|cross-functional| T["Team"]
    S -->|structured method| W["Workflow"]
    R --> DA["Devil's Advocate"]
    T --> DA
    W --> DA
    DA -->|pass| OUT["Deliver Result"]
    DA -->|challenge| LP
    LP -->|escalate| U
```

The flow is simple: you describe a task, Lead Producer classifies it and picks the minimum viable
team, specialists analyze it, Devil's Advocate stress-tests the result, and you get a consolidated
report. If the team cannot resolve a disagreement, Lead Producer escalates with both positions
documented.

## Context Overlays

This is a generic game development pack with zero product-specific knowledge.

If your game needs project-specific context, create a separate context module pack and map it to
the generic roles through a coordinator. The Lead Producer can then load those modules only when
they are explicitly named or routed in.

---

## Architecture

```text
lead-producer/
|-- .claude/                          # source of truth
|   |-- CLAUDE.md                     # routing table, loading rules, protocols
|   |-- settings.json                 # permission config
|   `-- skills/                       # skill directories
|       |-- lead-producer/SKILL.md
|       |-- role-economist/SKILL.md
|       |-- team-red-team/SKILL.md
|       `-- ...
|-- .codex/
|   `-- INSTALL.md                    # Codex install guide
|-- scripts/
|   |-- install-codex.sh              # macOS/Linux Codex installer
|   `-- install-codex.ps1             # Windows Codex installer
|-- whenupdating.md                   # maintenance checklist
|-- README.md
|-- LICENSE
`-- .gitignore
```

`.claude/skills/` is the single canonical source. Claude Code reads it directly. Codex links to it
via the install scripts. One source, two runtimes.

Skills load lazily: `CLAUDE.md` provides the routing rules, and individual skills load only when
the Lead Producer explicitly names them.

---

## Customization

**Add a role:** Create `.claude/skills/role-your-role/SKILL.md` with:

```yaml
---
name: role-your-role
description: "What this role does in one line"
---
```

Then add the routing entry to `.claude/CLAUDE.md`.

**Add a team:** Same structure, plus `context: fork` in frontmatter. Add `effort: high` if the
team has 5+ members or handles a high-risk domain.

**Create a context overlay:** Create a separate pack with its own coordinator that maps the overlay
modules to the generic roles in this pack.

# Lead Producer - Full-Stack AI Product Team

**A full-stack AI product team for building, reviewing, and hardening complex software.** Start
with one entry point: the Lead Producer assembles the right specialists, stress-tests the result,
and gives you a clear action plan instead of scattered opinions.

Built for MMO and live-service complexity, this pack shines on the hard stuff: economies,
progression, balance, exploits, smart contracts, live incidents, deployment risk, and systems that
interact in messy ways. That same depth makes it broadly useful outside games too: frontend design
and engineering, backend architecture, product strategy, QA, documentation, cleanup, refactors,
launch readiness, and post-launch operations.

46 AI skills: 28 specialist roles, 12 review teams, 5 structured workflows. Use it across the
full product lifecycle: prototype, design, implementation, testing, deployment, live ops,
iteration, and code cleanup. Works with **Claude Code** and **OpenAI Codex** on Mac and Windows.

## What It Looks Like

**Claude Code request**

```text
/lead-producer Review my crafting economy for exploits. Players craft items
from gathered resources and sell on the marketplace.
```

**Codex request**

```text
Use $lead-producer to review my crafting economy for exploits. Players craft
items from gathered resources and sell on the marketplace.
```

**Lead Producer routes to:** Red Team (adversarial) + Economy Team (structural)

**Output**

```text
LEAD PRODUCER REPORT
====================
Routing: Red Team (exploit surface) + Economy Team (faucet/sink balance)
Overlays: None required - no product-specific context loaded

FINDINGS (synthesized):

1. CRITICAL - Infinite craft loop: If crafting output is tradeable AND
   disassembly returns inputs, players can cycle items through alts to
   generate net-positive materials. Exploit requires only 2 accounts.
   Fix: disassembly returns 60-80% of inputs (configurable sink).

2. HIGH - Marketplace price floor bypass: Rare materials have no minimum
   listing price. Attackers can list at 1 currency to manipulate price
   oracles downstream. Fix: enforce floor at crafting-cost basis.

3. MEDIUM - Gathering bot profitability: Resource nodes respawn on fixed
   timers. Bot ROI is positive above 3 nodes/minute. Fix: randomize
   respawn windows +/-30% and add diminishing returns per-account.
```

This is what 46 specialists working together looks like: one prompt, structured analysis, and a
prioritized action plan.

## Why This Exists

AI coding assistants are generalists. They will often give you surface-level feedback on economy
design, miss non-obvious exploit chains, and skip the step where their own recommendations get
stress-tested.

This pack replaces "ask an assistant and hope" with a structured review process: domain specialists
analyze the problem, a Devil's Advocate challenges their assumptions, and the Lead Producer
synthesizes everything into an actionable result with evidence standards and severity rankings.

It also comes from synthesis, not reinvention. This pack takes inspiration from strong ideas in
`superpowers` and `compilation7`, then adapts them for the realities of end-to-end MMO and
live-service product development. The result is not a loose pile of specialist prompts or a direct
fork of another pack, but a coordinated team for design, frontend, backend, product, QA, smart
contracts, deployment, live ops, iteration, and cleanup.

You do not need to know the internal routing. Describe the problem. The Lead Producer figures out
who to call.

## Skill Design Principles

This repo works best when skills behave like decision systems, not essay generators.

- Operating philosophy should be executable: principles must translate into concrete behavior rules.
- Reports should be scannable first and deep second: a lead should grasp the recommendation fast.
- Systematic evaluation beats ad-hoc intuition: compare options with a consistent rubric.
- Evidence beats generic confidence: recommendations should cite verified context, trade-off logic, or explicit assumptions.
- Reversible decisions are preferred when uncertainty is high.
- Company values should show up in behavior, not just words: unity, courage, excellence, honesty.

For skills that depend on product, design, or domain context, consult project context sources when they
are available and worth the context cost. Eve Frontier Brain MCP is an optional configuration, not a
required setup step, because pulling too much external context can consume valuable tokens. If that
context is unavailable or intentionally skipped, state the gap explicitly and downgrade confidence rather
than filling the space with generic best practices.

When updating skills, prefer report structures that include:
- recommendation
- confidence
- verified context and assumptions
- decision criteria
- option comparison
- risks and mitigations
- open questions
- next step

See [whenupdating.md](./whenupdating.md) for the authoring rules that keep these patterns consistent.

## How It Works

```mermaid
graph TD
    U["You"] -->|describe task| C["Claude / Codex"]
    C -->|invoke| LP["Lead Producer"]
    LP -->|classify & route| S{"Select Specialists"}
    S -->|single domain| R["Role"]
    S -->|cross-functional| T["Team"]
    S -->|structured method| W["Workflow"]
    R --> DA["Devil's Advocate"]
    T --> DA
    W --> DA
    DA -->|pass| OUT["Deliver Result"]
    DA -->|challenge| LP
    LP -->|escalate| U
```

The flow is simple: you describe a task, Lead Producer classifies it and picks the minimum viable
team, specialists analyze it, Devil's Advocate stress-tests the result, and you get a consolidated
report. If the team cannot resolve a disagreement, Lead Producer escalates with both positions
documented.

**Claude Code**

```text
/lead-producer Production is down - players can't mint
```

```

### When specialists disagree

**Claude Code**

```text
/lead-producer Can we add PvP loot drops without breaking the economy?
```

**Codex**

```text
Use $lead-producer to assess whether PvP loot drops would break the economy.
```

### UI design comparison

**Claude Code**

```text
/lead-producer Design three options for guild management UI
```

**Codex**

```text
Use $lead-producer to design three options for guild management UI.
```

## Context Overlays

This is a generic game development pack with zero product-specific knowledge.

If your game needs project-specific context, create a separate context module pack and map it to
the generic roles through a coordinator. The Lead Producer can then load those modules only when
they are explicitly named or routed in.

---

## Architecture

```text
lead-producer/
|-- .claude/                          # source of truth
|   |-- CLAUDE.md                     # routing table, loading rules, protocols
|   |-- settings.json                 # permission config
|   `-- skills/                       # 46 skill directories
|       |-- lead-producer/SKILL.md
|       |-- role-economist/SKILL.md
|       |-- team-red-team/SKILL.md
|       `-- ...
|-- .codex/
|   `-- INSTALL.md                    # Codex install guide
|-- scripts/
|   |-- install-codex.sh              # macOS/Linux Codex installer
|   `-- install-codex.ps1             # Windows Codex installer
|-- whenupdating.md                   # maintenance checklist
|-- README.md
|-- LICENSE
`-- .gitignore
```

`.claude/skills/` is the single canonical source. Claude Code reads it directly. Codex links to it
via the install scripts. One source, two runtimes.

Skills load lazily: `CLAUDE.md` provides the routing rules, and individual skills load only when
the Lead Producer explicitly names them.

---

## Customization

**Add a role:** Create `.claude/skills/role-your-role/SKILL.md` with:

```yaml
---
name: role-your-role
description: "What this role does in one line"
---
```

Then add the routing entry to `.claude/CLAUDE.md`.

**Add a team:** Same structure, plus `context: fork` in frontmatter. Add `effort: high` if the
team has 5+ members or handles a high-risk domain.

**Create a context overlay:** Create a separate pack with its own coordinator that maps the overlay
modules to the generic roles in this pack.

# Frontend Team

## Purpose
Decide whether an interface is usable, implementable, accessible, and technically healthy to ship.

## Composition
- **role-ui-ux-designer**: flow quality, hierarchy, clarity, accessibility
- **role-frontend-engineer**: implementation quality, runtime behavior, state health
- **role-backend-engineer**: API and contract advisor for integration risk
- Synthesis: trade-offs, acceptance

## Use When
- Reviewing UI feature, screen, or frontend-heavy flow
- Checking accessibility, responsiveness, client-side architecture
- Evaluating frontend-backend integration quality

## Do NOT Use When
- Backend-only, infrastructure-only, or product-only
- Brand-definition with no implementation or UX question
- Narrow shadcn/ui method (use `workflow-shadcn-ui`)

## Workflow
1. Define critical user journey, key screens/states, and existing design patterns worth reusing.
2. Review UX, frontend implementation, and API dependence together.
3. Performance, failure handling, accessibility, and AI slop risk are part of the same verdict.
4. Synthesize trade-offs into one frontend recommendation.

## Default Output
```text
FRONTEND TEAM REVIEW
====================
Journey: main user flow, friction points, existing design leverage
Implementation: state/rendering/integration risks
Quality: accessibility gaps, responsive/failure-state issues, AI slop risk
Recommendation: ship / revise / escalate, highest-priority fixes
```

## Conflict Resolution
- UI/UX Designer owns user-experience quality. Frontend Engineer owns implementation feasibility.
- When UX and implementation conflict, find the smallest UX change that resolves the technical constraint.

## Anti-Drift Rules
- Do not expand into backend redesign under frontend review label.
- Reuse proven design leverage before inventing new UI language.
- Call out AI slop risk explicitly when it appears.
- Accessibility and error states are shipping requirements, not nice-to-haves.

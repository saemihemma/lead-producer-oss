# Project Discovery Workflow

## Purpose
Create shared situational awareness before design, implementation, or review work goes wide. Turn a vague or inherited project into a short list of concrete next plays.

## Use When
- Repo is inherited, large, or poorly mapped
- User asks for discovery, an R&D pass, or "understand this project first"
- Broad unknowns make direct implementation or review premature
- Major systems, docs, tests, or ownership boundaries are unclear

## Do NOT Use When
- Immediate bug investigation is the real task (use `workflow-systematic-debugging`)
- Architecture decision is already tightly scoped (use `team-architecture-review`)
- One bounded system needs current-reality orientation more than repo-wide mapping (use `workflow-current-state-capture`)
- User already has a narrow implementation slice ready to execute

## Workflow
1. Inspect repo shape: package manifests, framework configs, entry points, directory structure, test infrastructure, CI/CD setup, and active documentation.
2. Identify the top unknowns blocking confident execution.
3. Separate missing facts from preference or strategy questions.
4. Offer 2-3 timeboxed next plays sized to the uncertainty:
   - quick audit
   - focused architecture or subsystem spike
   - broader R&D or discovery pass
5. Recommend the smallest play that meaningfully reduces risk.

## Default Output
```text
PROJECT DISCOVERY REPORT
========================
Current State: repo shape, major systems, artifact maturity, useful existing signals
Top Unknowns: highest-risk things not yet understood
Options: 2-3 timeboxed plays with what each would clarify
Recommendation: smallest next play worth doing now
Next Step: what to inspect next, what decision to make, or recommended next LP route
```

## Output Discipline
- Default to in-chat output only.
- Do not create durable files unless the user explicitly asks.
- Keep options timeboxed and decision-oriented, not open-ended research wishlists.

## Anti-Drift Rules
- Discovery is for reducing uncertainty, not backdoor architecture work.
- Name what already exists before proposing more process.
- Recommend the smallest play that changes the next decision.
- Do not auto-chain into follow-on workflows.
- If a follow-on skill is warranted, recommend it back to LP instead of routing directly.
